# Terraform -- VPC Peering Connection

## Overview

Found new infrastructure to build. this will allow me to get some hands on experience with different AWS services using Terraform. Following this [Guide](https://www.itwonderlab.com/en/terraform-ansible-aws-howto/)  and provided access to this [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/itwonderlab/terraform-aws-ec2-rds-basic-free) will give me a better understanding using different AWS Services along with Terraform Infrastructure.

-----


# Getting Started

### VPC-Peering

Generic Vpc-Peering Architecture including:
   - 2 VPCs
   - 4 subnets
   - 2 EC2 instances

This example will be refined and improved in later modules.

## Running Terraform

Run the following to ensure ***terraform*** will only perform the expected
actions:

```sh
terraform fmt
terraform validate
terraform plan
terraform init
terraform apply
```

## Tearing Down the Terraformed Infrastructure

Run the following to verify that ***terraform*** will only impact the expected
nodes and then tear down the cluster.

```sh
terraform plan
terraform destroy
```

## VPC Subnet Creation

When calling the *module* at `main.tf` refer the created `variables` to set the needed *vpc_id* for peering-connection

The VPC- Alpha will be created using the `10.0.0.0/16` cidr range. The subnet cidr range `10.0.0.4/24` See [ipv4 Subnet Calculator](https://www.site24x7.com/tools/ipv4-subnetcalculator.html)

The VPC- Alpha will be created using the `172.31.0.0/16` cidr range. The subnet cidr range `1172.31.0.8/24` See [ipv4 Subnet Calculator](https://www.site24x7.com/tools/ipv4-subnetcalculator.html)

*VPC using AWS availability zones with a private and a public network*

Instance placement has to take into account that data transfer between different Availability Zones has a cost, therefore achieving high availability by distributing infrastructure between Availability Zones has an impact on the total budget

## Notes::
- Your VPC peering connection (pcx-0370d265896c59b61 | test-peer) has been established.
To send and receive traffic across this VPC peering connection, you must add a route to the peered VPC in one or more of your VPC route tables

- VPC A:-
  -  cidr:: 10.0.0.0/16
  - subnet cidr:: 10.0.0.4/32

- VPC B:-
  - cidr:: 172.31.0.0/16
  - subnet cidr:: 172.31.0.8/32

**WARNING**: Terraform Best Practices recommends **NEVER** publicly provide infrastructure's `.tfvars` files since in this could contain confidential infromation. 

Since this is just a **Personal Project** to help better understand the **Terraform** nothing of value would be in this `.tfvars` file. In this `ReadMe` will be the `variables` used for this **Personal Project** since `.gitignore` will leave out this file due to Best Practices.
